# Quantum Computing Project
This project comprises on few steps first is to gnerate quantum numbers using hamadad gate then measure those randowm numbers there measurement would give calssical values and would give true random numbers because it do not follow any algothirm but fundamentals of quantum mechanics we may use these turely generated random bits/number as secret key but since quantumn system changes it value when it interacts with anything thus this gnerated bit may interact with transmission line and this flip to avoid this fliping and to ensure the recevier gets the same secret key produced by the sender we add redundancy to the scerete key that is we would encode the key using hamming code (7,4) this code suggetes a specific combination of 4 data bits and 3 parities which are enough to dectect and locate the error once you know which parity is fillped you may filp exact that bit correct the error
